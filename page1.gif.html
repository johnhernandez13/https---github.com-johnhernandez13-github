<h1> Nissan GTR R35 VS Skyline R34</h1>
<h2>
HISTORY:While the first Skyline, built by the Prince Motor Company, made its debut in 1957, the first GT-R under the Nissan banner didn't make its appearance until 1969 (Nissan took over Prince in 1966).
The car's S20 2.0-liter dohc inline-6 was actually a detuned version of the R380 race car's engine and produced 160 bhp. The 2000GT-R was created to win the JAF Grand Prix, which it did, kick-starting Nissan's long success in motorsports. </h2>
