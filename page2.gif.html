<h1>R35 VS R34</h1>
<p>The fifth generation, known as the R34 kept the same 2.6 liter Twin Turbo engine from the previous models, but introduced a new chassis. The new car had a 50% stiffer body structure and was shorter than the R33. Improvements to the engine's valve timing and camshafts along with the ceramic turbocharger gave the engine an actual output of around 320 hp, although Nissan continued to advertise the car as having 280 hp. The 280 hp rule was a gentlemen's agreement in the Japanese auto industry, in which they adhered to the idea of not making cars with more than 280 horsepower in order to reduce high speed accidents. The R34 GT-R was also the first GT-R to feature a 5.8 inch LCD in the center console, that provided the driver with seven digitized information regarding the car's engine and dynamic parameters.</p>
It’s a thing of beauty. A 550-hp, twin-turbo V-6 and astounding, all-wheel-drive grip give the GT-R supercar performance. Its six-figure price is still cheap compared with anything else so quick. Numerous enhancements over the years have made it faster and more refined, with 0-to-60 times dropping below three seconds.
